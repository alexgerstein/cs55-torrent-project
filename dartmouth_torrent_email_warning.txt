Subject: FW: Notice ID: ******** Notice of Unauthorized Use of Paramount Pictures Corporation Property

Dartmouth College has received a notice claiming that an IP address registered to you has been used to offer for download via the Internet, without permission, a copyrighted work, cited in the complaint below.



Infringement is actionable under federal copyright law and can require the payment of damages of up to 0,000 per violation, as well as carrying the potential for criminal penalties. Respect for intellectual property ownership is a fundamental value in academia. Copyright infringement is also a violation of College policy. Additional information about the College's copyright policy - including peer-to-peer file sharing - can be found online at http://www.dartmouth.edu/copyright/.



By return e-mail, please indicate that (1) you have removed from your computer any programs that may be used to offer copyrighted material via the Internet for download by others without the copyright owner's permission (examples of such programs include BitTorrent and Limewire) and (2) that you will desist from activities that infringe copyright.  If you need assistance in removing file-sharing programs from your computer, the College's Computing Services department would be glad to assist you.  For this purpose, please contact the Student Help Desk or your IT Consultant.

If you fail to respond promptly, the College will block your IP address. The College must take this step in order to avail itself of the legal protection afforded service providers under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Please note, in most cases this notice comes as a result of the uploading or downloading of music, video, audio, movie or television files that, as a functionality of the file-sharing software used for downloading, is available for uploading by Internet requests without your awareness or permission anytime that your computer is turned on. Scans by copyright owners (such as the company that made the complaint in this case) capture both uploading and downloading of these files.



If you believe this notice is in error, or choose to challenge it, please contact me and I will explain the procedure. This procedure entails the filing on your part of a counter-notice asserting your right to the material and your right to distribute it, and satisfying all of the requisite legal formalities. Only after you have filed a proper counter-notice can a request to have your IP address unblocked be granted.



Thank you for your cooperation.  I look forward to hearing from you.
