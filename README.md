## Student Perception of Torrenting
1. Administer a survey to students asking:
	* Have you ever downloaded files such as music or movies via torrenting? Have you used sites such as ____, _____, or _____ to download files?
	* Have you ever downloaded such files while at Dartmouth via torrenting?
	* How many files, on average, do you download via torrenting per month while at Dartmouth?
	* How often do you think that other people download music or other files illegally per month?
	* Do you think that Dartmouth records when you or someone else downloads files illegally?
	* If you were told that they did record this information, would it affect how often you download files illegally?
	* Where do you get most of the movies, music, and other media files in your personal iTunes Library? 
	* Class Year
	* Male/Female
	* Major
