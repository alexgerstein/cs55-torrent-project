Perceptions and Use of BitTorrent P2P File Sharing by Dartmouth College Students
====================
Alex Gerstein & Scott Gladstone

In our final project, we hope to investigate peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing network protocols, specifically those related to torrenting (BitTorrent). After a general overview of the system and security flaws present, we plan to examine P2P in the context of Dartmouth College. By surveying students and speaking to Dartmouth College Computing Services, we hope to understand the disparity between the perception and actual use by students of torrent networks. If available, we also hope to obtain and analyze data from the College on student bandwidth habits, download frequencies, or other metrics that the College records. The outline below summarizes the questions we hope to answer and the individuals we hope to speak with.

## Introduction
1. What is a P2P file sharing network?
2. What is BitTorrent (protocol)?
	* What makes BitTorrent difficult to track?
	* What are security issues related to using BitTorrent?
3. What are past incidences of torrenting among college students?

## Legal Issues
1. What are the legal implications for an individual user for torrenting?
2. What are the legal implications for a university like Dartmouth with students that torrent?
3. What are some past cases and punishments relating to torrenting?

## Student Perception of Torrenting
- Administer a survey to students asking:
	* Have you ever downloaded files such as music or movies via torrenting? Have you used sites such as ____, _____, or _____ to download files?
	* Have you ever downloaded such files while at Dartmouth via torrenting?
	* How many files, on average, do you download via torrenting per month while at Dartmouth?
	* How often do you think that other people download music or other files illegally per month?
	* Do you think that Dartmouth records when you or someone else downloads files illegally?
	* If you were told that they did record this information, would it affect how often you download files illegally?
	* Where do you get most of the movies, music, and other media files in your personal iTunes Library? 
	* Class Year
	* Male/Female
	* Major

## Dartmouth Computing Services Network Data
1. Talk with:
	* Ellen Waite-Franzen, VP IT/CIO - Ellen.Waite-Franzen@Dartmouth.edu
	* Joe Doucet, CTO/Deputy CIO - Joseph.R.Doucet@Dartmouth.edu
	* Steve Nyman, CISO - Steven.M.Nyman@dartmouth.edu
	* Frank Archambeault, Network Services - frank.archambeault@dartmouth.edu
2. Talk about:
	* How Dartmouth tracks users' bandwidth: is there data that we can use?
	* Can Dartmouth detect when someone is torrenting? If so, how frequently do Dartmouth students do it?
	* If Dartmouth determines a student has been downloading illegal content, what can they do about it?
	* Have any legal actions been taken in the past? 

## Data Analysis and Observations
- Student surveys
	* Analyze results on perceptions
	* Compare with any provided data from computing services
	* Compare with other colleges, if data/other studies are available

## Conclusions and Recommendations
1. Is there a disparity between students' perception and actual practice of torrenting?
2. Are students torrenting more or less frequently than other students or the College perceives?
3. Can recommendations be made such that student action and Dartmouth desires toward torrenting are aligned?
4. How private is student browser/bandwidth data?
5. Is there value in making this information public in terms of curbing student torrenting habits?
